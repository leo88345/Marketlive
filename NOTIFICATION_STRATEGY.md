# 📱 Optimal Notification Strategy for News App

## 🎯 **Recommended Schedule**

### **Priority-Based Notifications:**

- **When**: Instantly
- **Why**: Breaking market-moving news
- **Examples**: Fed rate cuts, major geopolitical events, corporate bankruptcies

#### **🟡 Batched High (Score 8-8.9)**  
- **Business Hours**: Every 30 minutes (9 AM - 6 PM)
- **Evening**: Every 2 hours (6 PM - 10 PM)
- **Why**: Important but not urgent enough to interrupt immediately

#### **🟢 Batched Medium (Score 7-7.9)**
- **Business Hours**: Every 2 hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
- **Evening**: Daily digest at 8 PM

2. **Maintains Urgency**: Immediate delivery for critical news  
3. **Respects User Time**: Quiet hours and weekend modes
4. **Customizable**: Users control their experience
5. **Premium Value**: Intelligent filtering vs spam

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

- **Rich Notifications**: Show score, source, and summary preview
